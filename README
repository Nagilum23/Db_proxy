Db_proxy version 1.08
=====================

This module and the included cgi can be used to proxy access to a database
via cgi-bin. This allows (for example) to share a single SQLite database
with multiple hosts.

This archive includes a client libarary used to access the installed
"server". It also includes the server which provides access to the database
to the clients and a sample client.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL [PREFIX=~]
   make
   make test
   make install

You will have to set up the 'server'. The bundled server is simple cgi with a 
plaintext configuration file. It contains no access controls so you will have
to use .htaccess or similar mechanisms to protect your database!
The usual *_proxy environment variables will be honoured.
If you want to access an SSL protected server see Crypt::SSLeay(3pm)
for relevant environment variables to configure things like 
client auth, ca-bundle, etc..

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  HTTP::Request, YAML

If you want access SSL protected content you'll also need Crypt::SSLeay .
